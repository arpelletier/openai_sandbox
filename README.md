# Open AI Sandbox

This is a testing repository for trying out OpenAI's API. 

Source: https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries/python-library

So far, I have created a commandline interface to chat with their API. It takes user input from the terminal and sends to the API. Queries and responses are logged automatically.

### Example
